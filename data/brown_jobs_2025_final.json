We believe the arts are fundamental to critical inquiry into the most pressing questions facing humanity worldwide, and we support artists operating at the highest levels of their craft to inform and be informed by scholars in disciplines across the sciences, social sciences, and humanities.\nArtsCrew Members are a key component of The BAI’s operations and the larger arts and culture ecosystem throughout Brown University and Rhode Island at large. Members assist in planning, executing, and evaluating programs and events while learning hands-on skills in several areas of arts work.

Employees in Production or Preparator shifts must be able to lift 40 pounds. All positions may require employees to stand for extended periods.\nCompetencies:\nPlease note: Applicants are not expected to meet every competency listed below, as some are specific to certain roles within ArtsCrew.

They also track comments in Canvas discussions and track attendance taken via Tophat technology platform.\n3) Developing List (including brief summary and key issues) of ~25 HBS cases from which students can write final papers. This list is used the next time we teach the course. This work is researching/reading many cases quickly to identify those appropriate to final papers.

A vast scholarship across the social sciences has fixated on states’ use of ‘sticks’ (such as coercion, penalties for breaking the law, which include monetary fines and even imprisonment) and ‘carrots’ (for example, a range of  incentives). This ‘rational’ repertoire of tactics is certainly important but also insufficient. States across the world and through time have relied equally and arguably, even more heavily, on a vast, relatively underemphasized but potent reservoir of cultural and ideational power to persuade and gain the cooperation of their citizens.

That is, while governments are cajoled and called upon to produce economic growth, do something about economic inequality and social mobility, and improve the life chances of citizens through purposive action, actually delivering these things is incredibly hard. Likewise firms are supposed to police their supply chains, decarbonize their operations, raise their wages, and pay more taxes, all at once. These areas constitute ‘hard problems’ for two main reasons. Economically, we don’t really have much of a clue about how to do many of these things.

Simmons Center for the Study of Slavery & Justice (Simmons Center) is looking to hire creative and energetic Caretakers for the Symbolic Garden of the Enslaved for the summer (with the potential to continue). The Simmons Center is a scholarly research center with a public humanities mission. Our work is focused on projects and research clusters that examine the history and legacies of the racial slave trade.\nIn small spaces beside their cabins and huts on the plantation, along marginalized hillsides, in swamps, gullies and forests, and in outdoor sanctuaries created to honor their dead and contemplate that ancestrality, enslaved Africans and their descendants throughout the Americas “stole” back their own time and labor in snatches of the night, on Sundays or “holidays,” to plant garden plots of use, beauty, and spiritual and physical refuge. The Simmons Center's Symbolic Garden of the Enslaved designed by Prof. Geri Augusto draws on that history to render imaginatively a small part of what the slaves knew and wrought, and what they might have thought as they created new landscapes against all odds. It is a work of cognitive justice and contemplation.\nResponsibilities\nThe Caretakers for the Symbolic Garden of the Enslaved will meet regularly (around once per month) with Simmons Center staff to learn about and plan for the physical and intellectual maintenance and growth of the Simmons Center’s Symbolic Garden of the Enslaved and associated programming. During warmer months, work will also include providing physical care for the garden on a regular basis including weeding, planting, watering, painting of the garden wall, and helping with other improvements and general upkeep as assigned. Caretakers will also be involved with creating documentation and both planning and participating in public programming about the garden as a public memorial space on campus.\nQualifications\nStrong written and verbal communication skills, very organized and self motivated. Past experience and/or interest in learning about plants and gardening required. Background in Africana Studies/History/Native American and Indigenous Studies/Environmental Studies preferred.\nAdditional information\nThis position will begin June 2025 and run through the end of summer (with potential to continue into the academic year). The position is flexible and varied in terms of hours, but we anticipate Caretakers will work around 10-20 hours per month during colder months (for planning meetings and research) and 2-4 additional hours per week during warmer months (for garden maintenance and programming work). We are especially interested in working with students who might be on campus during summer 2025.

The advisor then takes part in a committee meeting to discuss applicant feedback and meets with the student to relay the feedback.\nPost-application support: Advisors provide each student with one 30-minute advising session to discuss the outcome of the review process. For non-nominated students, this session entails debriefing on their application and identifying further fellowship and experiential learning opportunities to explore. For nominated students, this session entails discussing feedback to strengthen, finalize, and submit their application.\nMock interview committee: Advisors serve on a rolling mock interview committee that convenes to support students invited to interview for select fellowship opportunities. Mock interviews take place in October and November, with each interview lasting 1 hour. Advisors are expected to develop interview questions that center the applicant’s work, personality, and goals as well as realistically simulate experience of that specific opportunity (e.g., behavioral interview questions or position/stance questions). Typically, 10-15 mock interviews are convened each year for the fellowships supported by advisors.\nInstitutional letters of endorsement: Advisors prepare draft letters of endorsement for select fellowship opportunities.\nTime Commitment: \nAnticipated for 320 total hours (approximately 10-20 hours a week for 4-6 months), beginning as early as June 1 and ending as late as November 30.\nDuration:\nAnticipated 4-6 months – beginning as early as June 1 and ending as late as November 30.\nRate:  This is a paid position at $23.00/hr. for any work taken on beyond the graduate school primary appointment, as per GLO guidelines.\nJob Competencies:\nStrong proficiency in written and verbal communication, with demonstrated ability to communicate effectively across multiple audiences.\nSkillful judgment and discretion in handling FERPA-protected and confidential materials.\nAbility to meet necessary deadlines and manage multiple time-sensitive processes.\nDemonstrated ability to support a community of diverse perspectives and cultures in an inclusive environment, as well as demonstrated success in collaborative work with diverse faculty, students, and staff.\nDemonstrated experience advocating for and making change toward goals for diversity, inclusion, and equity while supporting students from historically underrepresented and/or minoritized backgrounds. (Note: All Fellowships Advisors are required to undergo anti-bias training as well as read provided materials before advising students. We want to ensure that all students of all backgrounds and identities feel welcome and supported when meeting with advisors.)\nExperience working with students, effective presentation skills, and experience in or working knowledge of select national and/or international fellowships application processes preferred.\nEligibility:\nMust be a PhD student, PhD candidates beyond their third year of graduate study preferred\nIf on full summer stipend, employment conditional on submission and receipt of a request for exemption from the 12-hour limit (see Activities Outside of Stipended Appointments for more information)\nFor more information, please contact: fellowships@brown.edu\nRecruiting Start Date:\n2025-04-03\nJob Posting Title:\nGraduate Fellowship Advisor\nDepartment:\nThe College\nGrade:\nUngraded - Student\nHourly Range:\nMinimum:\n15\nMidpoint:\n16.375\nMaximum:\n17.75\nScheduled Weekly Hours:\n10\nSubmission Guidelines:\nPlease note that in order to be considered an applicant for any student job at Brown University you must submit an application form for each position for which you believe you are qualified.
